# Welcome!

In this scenario, you'll learn how to create a [mesosctl](https://github.com/mesoshq/mesosctl) cluster. A default configuration is provided, which you can use right away.
### Hints

You can use `help`{{execute}} to display the overall help, and `<commandName>`, for example `config` followed by ENTER to get help for specific commands. 

Also, pressing the TAB key (twice) will trigger command auto-completion.
