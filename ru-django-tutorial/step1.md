If this is your first time using Django, you’ll have to take care of
some initial setup. Namely, you’ll need to auto-generate some code that
establishes a Django project – a collection of settings for an instance
of Django, including database configuration, Django-specific options and
application-specific settings.

From the command line run the following command:

```
$ django-admin startproject mysite
```

This will create a `mysite` directory in your current directory. If it
didn’t work, see [Problems running django-admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/faq/troubleshooting/#troubleshooting-django-admin).

### Note

You’ll need to avoid naming projects after built-in Python or Django
components. In particular, this means you should avoid using names like
`django` (which will conflict with Django itself) or `test` (which
conflicts with a built-in Python package).

### Where should this code live?

If your background is in plain old PHP (with no use of modern
frameworks), you’re probably used to putting code under the Web server’s
document root (in a place such as `/var/www`). With Django, you don’t do
that. It’s not a good idea to put any of this Python code within your
Web server’s document root, because it risks the possibility that people
may be able to view your code over the Web. That’s not good for
security.

Put your code in some directory outside of the document root, such as
`/home/mycode`. For this tutorial, don't worry about the location.

Let’s look at what `startproject` created:

```
$ ls -R1 mysite
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
```

These files are:

- The outer `mysite/` root directory is just a container for your
  project. Its name doesn’t matter to Django; you can rename it to
  anything you like.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this
  Django project in various ways. You can read all the details about
  `manage.py` in [`django-admin` and `manage.py`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/ref/django-admin/).
- The inner `mysite/` directory is the actual Python package for your
  project. Its name is the Python package name you’ll need to use to
  import anything inside it (e.g. `mysite.urls`).
- `mysite/__init__.py`: An empty file that tells Python that this
  directory should be considered a Python package. If you’re a Python
  beginner, read more about packages in the official Python docs.
- `mysite/settings.py`: Settings/configuration for this Django project.
  Django settings will tell you all about how settings work.
- `mysite/urls.py`: The URL declarations for this Django project; a
  "table of contents" of your Django-powered site. You can read more
  about URLs in URL dispatcher.
- `mysite/wsgi.py`: An entry-point for WSGI-compatible web servers to
  serve your project. See How to deploy with WSGI for more details.
