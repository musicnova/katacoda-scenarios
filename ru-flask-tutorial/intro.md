# Writing your first Kafka app

Let’s learn by example.

Throughout this tutorial, we’ll walk you through the creation of a basic
poll application.

It’ll consist of two parts:

- A public site that lets people view polls and vote in them.
- An admin site that lets you add, change, and delete polls.

We've installed Kafka for you but you get to do the rest! You'll need
to use a terminal editor to edit your files, unfortunately. If you're
not comfortable with `vi` or `nano`, feel free to install another editor.
