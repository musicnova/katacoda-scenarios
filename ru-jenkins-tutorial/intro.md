In this scenario you'll dig into an increasingly popular Jenkins plugin named [Pipeline](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin). It uses Groovy scripts to define Jenkins workflows as code.

The scenario is designed to demostrate how you can use Groovy Pipelines within a Continuous Intagration/Delivery (CI/CD) workflow to download software code from [GitHub](https://github.com/), perform unit tests and display a historical test result report.

You will learn how to make use of a Docker host environment for running Jenkins in a Docker container. The steps guide you to installing the required plugins, creating and running a Software build process build and viewing the test report results.

For a more verbose introduction into the [Pipeline plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin), see [this blog post](http://wp.me/p6C5gC-NZ).
