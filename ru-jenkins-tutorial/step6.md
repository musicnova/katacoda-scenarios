We now will create our first Jenkins Pipeline project.

####Â Task: Create a Pipeline Workflow

1. On the **Jenkins** dashboard, select **create new jobs** under the Welcome message or **new Item* in the sidebar menue.
2. Give the job a friendly name such as **Pipeline Hello World**, select **Pipeline** and press **OK**.
3. On the upper right corner of the Pipeline Script Textbox, find the drop-down menue **try sample pipeline...** and choose **GitHub + Maven**
4. Review the Groovy code. You will see that we will use git for cloning a sample project and we will build the project using the Maven installation we had named "M3".
5. Click **Save**

In the next step, we will try it out.
